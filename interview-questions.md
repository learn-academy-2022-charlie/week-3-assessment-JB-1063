# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: We have used `this` in class in the lectures and challenges. Specifically in the Object MethodIn where `this was used as keyword for the object.

  Researched answer: In JavaScript the word `this` is a keyword, and refers to an object.
  Depending on how it is used, the word `this` may refer to a different object. It is probably more commonly used in the object method where `this` refers to the object. If used alone or in a function, `this` refers to the global object. It can refer to any object if used in Methods like call(), apply(), and bind(). It refers to the receiving element if used in an event.   If used in strict mode in a function, the word `this` is undefined.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is usefull for adding bits functions to big applications like what they used in Facebook. Facebook developed react to add different functionalities in their program. With React small changes can be made without having to refresh the entire page making the application more efficient.

  Researched answer: 
  React is a library of javascript codes for user interface. It makes use of components that acts like functions. Each component or group of codes are independent and reusable and can work in isolation. Probably works in similar fashion as mini factories that can be called up to do a variety of functions. It updates each users' interaction with an application more quickly. A lot of application nowadays are more faster by using React components and this trend will probably be continuing in the next coming years.


3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: Render

  Researched answer: Render is a method in react. It tells react what to display
for the user interface.


4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a syntax expression to javascript. One syntax difference is the use of className instead of class which is reserved for HTML.

  Researched answer:
  JSX is created for React to allow developers to write HTML within javascript.The main difference is that in JSX, a single parent element must be returned. It is not required in HTML. Another difference is the use of camelCase for all HTML attributes and event reference if you are writing JSX. Another difference is that tags can self-close in JSX



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a package manager. Instead of a user adding numerous lines of codes, yarn makes it easier for the user to add yarn with just typing the three words, "yarn add jest". It modifies files to let the user test code easier.
  Researched answer:
  Yarn(Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is used in javascript coding as a package manager. It helps users to develop and run javascript code outside of a browser.


6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: An anonymous function does not have any name declared or associated to identify it. Charlean have used it in one example in her lecture but I vaguely remember how she used it.

  Researched answer: No keyword is used when declaring an anymous function. In most instances it has no name between the function keyword and the parenthesis. It can be used as an argument. It can also be immediately invoked as a function. It is not accessible after initial creation and has to be assigned to a variable.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: It allows to render different elements or components based on a condition. Like a different greeting for a different occasion or a different greeting based on time of day or perhaps date. The different names of person can be used depending on who is using the interface.

2. Object-oriented programming: A programming style that prioritizes the code design around data or objects instead of function and logic. It makes it easier to troubleshoot. It makes is easier to reuse code using inheritance. It also gives the code flexibility and a more effective problem solving

3. Ruby: A programing language that is open sourced and object oriented. Easy to read and write. It has many built in methods and documentation

4. Ruby blocks: A group of anonymous codes that can act as function and can be passed into methods. Usually used to reduce repetition and reduce errors. They are usually enclosed with braces or enclosures.

5. Ruby hashes: Ruby hashes are a collection of key value pairs.It is similar to arrays but is indexed according to the assigned keys instead of an integer index.
